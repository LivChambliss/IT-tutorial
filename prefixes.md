## Prefixes in IT

There are numerous types of prefixes when dealing with information technology terminology. They all help guide us to understand certain sizes 
and types of information we are dealing with

The most common prefixes in IT are: **kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta, and exa.**

### Kilo
You may have heard of a kilo from previous learning experiences, and you may have learned that it typically holds a value of 1000. In IT, due to the
binary principles, which has a base of 2, one kilo represents 1024 bytes. 

### Mega
Through other experiences, you may have heard mega as having a value of one million. Because of the binary principals, mega holds a value of 1048576 bytes.
