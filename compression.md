## Compression

Compression is a form of coding in which you can reduce the amounts of bits used in order to communicate the same tast or piece of information. 

### Lossless Compression
"Lossless compression is s a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression)
Lossless compression can be found encoded into ZIP files and is important when original data needs to be identical to decompressed data.

### Lossy Compression
"Lossy Compression is the class of data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression)
Lossy compression can be found in JPEG files as well as MP3 or AAC. When looking at an image, you may see the "lossyness" through blurred, pixelated, or 
jagged edges. It is typically the result of lost data and information.

Examples of compression:
30 bytes of string:
LLLLLLLXXXXXXXXXRRRRRRTTTTTTTT

8 byte string:
7L16X6R8T

30 bytes were converted into 8 bytes
