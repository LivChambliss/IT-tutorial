## What is a bit? 
"A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in a computer" (whatis.techtarget.com). A byte is a memory unit that can hold a value of either a 1 or a 0. 
When a byte holds a value of "1" it is considered to be "turned on." When a byte holds a value of "0" the byte is considered to be "turned off." 



## What is a byte? 
A **byte** is "*a group of binary digits or bits (usually eight) operated on as a unit*" (google). Each byte can be used in a computer to represent 
a number, letter, or any other value assigned to the byte. When using ones and zeros in a byte that holds eight bits, you can represent a number as little
as 0 and as great at 2048.
